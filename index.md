title: Workshop on Logics and Ontologies for Natural Language (LogOnto) - September 22, 2014
---

## Aims and Scope

Formal tools coming from logic, ontologies and automated reasoning are
important for natural language processing, lexical semantics and in
general for computational semantics.  The workshop invites papers on
formal approaches on dealing with semantics, as well as on the
combination between logical methods and statistical methods for
acquiring and using ontologies for computational semantics, especially
for languages less endowed with lexical resources.

The workshop is associated with
[FOIS 2014](http://fois2014.inf.ufes.br).

## Conference Topics

Specific topics include, but are not limited to:

- logic for semantics of lexical items, sentences, discourse and
  dialog
- ontologies for applications in Portuguese
- formal tools in ontology creation, re-use and evaluation
- formal tools in textual inference, such as logics for natural
  language inference
- description and modal logics in semantics
- formal approaches to unifying data-driven and declarative approaches
  to semantics

## OpenWordnet-PT

The [OpenWN-PT site](http://logics.emap.fgv.br/wn/) is now open for
easy online consultation, as discussed at the
workshop. ([downloading](http://github.com/arademaker/openWordnet-PT)
has been available since 2010) We hope that linguists and computer
scientists interested in lexical resources will help us improve the
resource. This is the goal of the boxes for comments below each entry:
don't be shy, complain of wrong meanings, ask us to add new ones
and/or suggest new functionality. We will do the best we can, no
guarantees though.
