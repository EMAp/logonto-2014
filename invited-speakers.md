## Renata Vieira: Ontologies for NLP, NLP for ontologies

In this talk I will say a few words about the relation of ontologies
and natural language processing, considering this relation in two
directions. I will show some examples of how some natural language
applications use ontologies as a resource, and how we can build and
maintain ontologies with the help of natural language processing. All
this will be seen from a perspective of the Portuguese language, as it
has been an essencial part of my work.

### Short bio

[Renata Vieira](http://www.inf.pucrs.br/~rvieira/) works in the area
of artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, ontologies,
semantic web and natural processing, with special interests in the
Portuguese language, but also considering multi- lingual questions. In
this area she has a leading role in Brazil, for she worked in the
creation of a special interest group for the area in the Brazilian
Computing Society. She has been a member of the Executive Committe of
the International Association for Computational Linguistcs, the main
international scientific organization in this subject. Her publication
records are among the top ones in the country for this area.


## Adam Pease: Formal Ontology and the use of the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) in Linguistics

This talk presents an overview of formal ontology, and how the
[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology](http://www.ontologyportal.org)
(SUMO) has been used in linguistic applications. Classes of
ontology-based applications are introduced. Issues of the capabilities
and tradeoffs in first order logic inference are explored.  The SUMO
is also described in detail, along with its mappings to the WordNet
lexicon.

### Short bio

[Adam Pease](http://www.adampease.org/professional/) has led research
in ontology, linguistics, and formal inference, including development
of the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO), the Controlled English
to Logic Translation (CELT) system, the Core Plan Representation
(CPR), and the Sigma knowledge engineering environment. Sharing
research under open licenses, in order to achieve the widest possible
dissemination and technology transfer, has been a core element of his
research program and his products have been downloaded by thousands of
people around the world.  He is the author of the new book "Ontology:
A Practical Guide".
