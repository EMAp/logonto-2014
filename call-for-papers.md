<pre>
Workshop on LOGICS and ONTOLOGIES for NATURAL LANGUAGE (LogOnto 2014)
http://empa.fgv.br/logonto-2014/

27 September, 2014 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Paper submission deadline: May 22, 2014 (extended to May 30)

AIMS AND SCOPE

Formal tools coming from logic, ontologies and automated reasoning are
important for natural language processing, lexical semantics and in
general for computational semantics.  The workshop invites papers on
formal approaches on dealing with semantics, as well as on the
combination between logical methods and statistical methods for
acquiring and using ontologies for computational semantics, especially
for languages less endowed with lexical resources.


Specific topics include, but are not limited to:

- logic for semantics of lexical items, sentences, discourse and
  dialog
- ontologies for applications in Portuguese
- formal tools in ontology creation, re-use and evaluation
- formal tools in textual inference, such as logics for natural
  language inference
- description and modal logics in semantics
- formal approaches to unifying data-driven and declarative approaches
  to semantics
