  <h2> Invited Speakers </h2>

  <h2>Renata Vieira: Ontologies for NLP, NLP for ontologies</h2>

<p>In this talk I will say a few words about the relation of ontologies
and natural language processing, considering this relation in two
directions. I will show some examples of how some natural language
applications use ontologies as a resource, and how we can build and
maintain ontologies with the help of natural language processing. All
this will be seen from a perspective of the Portuguese language, as it
has been an essencial part of my work.</p>

<h3>Short bio</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.inf.pucrs.br/~rvieira/">Renata Vieira</a> works in the area
of artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, ontologies,
semantic web and natural processing, with special interests in the
Portuguese language, but also considering multi- lingual questions. In
this area she has a leading role in Brazil, for she worked in the
creation of a special interest group for the area in the Brazilian
Computing Society. She has been a member of the Executive Committe of
the International Association for Computational Linguistcs, the main
international scientific organization in this subject. Her publication
records are among the top ones in the country for this area.</p>

<h2>Edward Hermann Haeusler: Kelsenian Jurisprudence, legal ontologies and intuitionistic logic</h2>

<p>Description Logic has been frequently used in representing
knowledge. Sometimes we use the term "ontology" for denoting a
specific domain knowledge representation. When representing legal
knowledge a jurisprudence (theory of law) must be used as a basis for
legal ontologies. In this talk we discuss how Kelsenian jurisprudence,
apparently the most adequate jurisprudence choice for (practical)
knowledge representation, asks for an intuitionistic logical basis for
legal ontologies construction. We show how the use of an
intuitionistic description logic can be successfully used in
representing legal ontologies circumventing apparent conflicts in
law. A case of conflict of laws in space in formally detailed and
solved using our approach.</p>

<h3>Short bio</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.tecmf.inf.puc-rio.br/EdwardHermann">Hermann</a> is Associate
Professor of Informatics at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de
Janeiro (PUC-Rio). He received his D.Sc. in Informatics from
PUC-Rio. His recent works are in Logic and Proof Theory, with
applications to Computer Science.</p>

<h2>Vinay Chaudhri: Challenges in Commercializing Expert Knowledge Authoring</h2>

<p>Formal knowledge representation is a powerful tool for better
understanding and communication of knowledge.  Natural language
interfaces to formal knowledge bases enable users unfamiliar with the
intricacies of the representation to access the encoded knowledge.
AURA is a software system aimed at domain experts to ease knowledge
authoring. To support access to this knowledge, it also supports a
natural language front end for posing questions. With the goal of
commercializing this technology, we built an electronic textbook
application aimed at students studying from a biology textbook.  I
will discuss the challenges we have faced in deploying this technology
in a commercially viable manner and some of the open problems that
still need to be solved.</p>

<h3>Short bio</h3>

<p>Dr. Vinay K. Chaudhri is a program director in the Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Center at SRI International. His research focuses on
the science and engineering of large knowledge base systems and spans
knowledge representation and reasoning, question answering, knowledge
acquisition, and innovative applications. His most recent work has
been on creating an intelligent textbook in biology that answers a
student's questions and leads to significant learning gains. He has
co-edited a volume on the Theory and Application of conceptual
modeling, and two special issues of AI Magazine - one on Question
Answering Systems, and another on Application of AI to Contemporary
and Emerging Education Challenges. He has taught a course on Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning at Stanford University.</p>

<p>He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Toronto where
he was a Connaught Scholar and a Fellow of Massey College. He also
holds a Masters in Industrial and Management Engineering from Indian
Institute of Technology Kanpur, and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical
Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra . He is
a senior member of AAAI.</p>
